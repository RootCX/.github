## Mission
**We believe that the future of business software belongs to open source.**

Development is currently stuck between rigid SaaS "black boxes" and fragile "vibe coding" from scratch. RootCX provides a 3rd way: an enterprise-grade studio for developing malleable software.

As a reference implementation, we provide a production-ready suite of open source business apps (CRM, Helpdesk, Project Management, Chat, Billing). These are high-quality, collaborative standards - as polished as the leading SaaS giants - designed to be used out-of-the-box or extended with AI. By providing the "wiring" (schemas, logic, governance), RootCX allows you to adapt the software to your specific needs instead of forcing your process to adapt to the tool.

### 🚧 Current Status
RootCX is under active development. A fully open-source version will be released soon.
